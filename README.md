# Don-t-Overfit-II-ML-Problem

## Problem Statement

In this problem, we have to find out target having 0 and 1, but with the twist. <br />
This problem having very less training dataset rows but having large set of data in the testing dataset, which means we can easily overfit.<br />
We need to device the algo in that sense that it does not overfit the data in the testing dataset.<br />

## Data availability

Both train and test dataset is available having different number of rows and column.<br />
* Test data does not contain target column; but are very high in number of rows(data).<br />
* Train data contains  target column having value as 1 and 0 value but are very less in number.<br />

## Modelling

Using Logistic Regression, we are getting highest accuracy for the testing dataset.<br />
